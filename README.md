## My process

I started the project with `create-react-app` to bootstrap the webpack and react development environment. I then proceeded to build the desktop UI from the designs provided in the challenge. When the UI was ready, I integrated it with the API.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Material UI
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

This project was helpful to get better understanding of Material UI v5. I also had a refresher in integration with 3rd party APIs. I have used the javascript fetch API for this integration and it was great to learn this inbuilt API rather than using some libraries for data fetching.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I further intend to also develop the mobile responsive views for this project.
